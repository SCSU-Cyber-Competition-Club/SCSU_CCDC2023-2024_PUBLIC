1. Setting Up a DNS Server On Windows Server:

Install the DNS Server Role:

Open Server Manager.
Navigate to Manage > Add Roles and Features.
Select Role-based or feature-based installation.
Choose the appropriate server.
In the Roles list, select DNS Server.
Proceed through the wizard and click Install.

2. Configure DNS Zones:

Open DNS Manager (found in Administrative Tools).
Right-click on Forward Lookup Zones and select New Zone.
Follow the wizard to create a Primary Zone, specifying the zone name (e.g., example.com).
Repeat the process for Reverse Lookup Zones if needed.

3. Add DNS Records:

In DNS Manager, navigate to your newly created zone.
Right-click in the right pane and select New Host (A or AAAA).
Enter the Name and IP address for the host.
Click Add Host.
For mail servers, add MX records by right-clicking the zone and selecting New Mail Exchanger (MX).

4. Configure Forwarders (Optional):

In DNS Manager, right-click the server name and select Properties.
Go to the Forwarders tab.
Click Edit and add the IP addresses of external DNS servers to which queries should be forwarded.

5. Test the Configuration:

Use the nslookup command to verify DNS resolution.
Ensure that clients can resolve domain names correctly.

Setting DNS On Linux (Using BIND9):

1. Install BIND9:

Update your package list:
sudo apt update

Install BIND9:
sudo apt install bind9

2. Configure the DNS Server:

Edit the BIND configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.options
Set the forwarders to external DNS servers:

forwarders {
    8.8.8.8;
    8.8.4.4;
};
Save and exit the file.

3. Create DNS Zones:

Define the zone in the BIND configuration:

sudo nano /etc/bind/named.conf.local
Add the following:

zone "CCDCcomp.com" {
    type master;
    file "/etc/bind/zones/db.CCDCcomp.com";
};

Create the zone file directory:
sudo mkdir /etc/bind/zones

Create the zone file:
sudo nano /etc/bind/zones/db.CCDCcomp.com

Add the zone information:

;
; BIND data file for example.com
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     ns1.CCDCcomp.com. admin.CCDCcomp.com. (
                      3         ; Serial
                 604800         ; Refresh
                  86400         ; Retry
                2419200         ; Expire
                 604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
;
@       IN      NS      ns1.CCDCcomp.com.
ns1     IN      A       192.168.1.1
www     IN      A       192.168.1.2
mail    IN      A       192.168.1.3
@       IN      MX      10 mail.CCDCcomp.com.

In nano or vim Save and exit the file.

4. Restart BIND9:
sudo systemctl restart bind9

5. Test the Configuration:
Use the dig command to verify DNS resolution:
dig @localhost example.com
Ensure that clients can resolve domain names correctly.

Identifying and Remediating Vulnerabilities to Kerberos-Based Attacks
Identifying Vulnerable Accounts:

1. Enumerate Service Principal Names (SPNs):

Use PowerShell to list accounts with SPNs:
Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

2. Analyze Account Privileges:
Identify accounts with high privileges and SPNs, as they are prime targets for attacks like Kerberoasting.

3. Monitor Kerberos Ticket Requests:

Enable auditing for Kerberos service ticket requests.
Analyze Event ID 4769 in the Security logs for unusual patterns or a high number of requests.
--------------------------------
--------------------------------
Remediation Steps:
1. Strengthen Service Account Passwords:

Ensure service accounts have complex, high-entropy passwords to resist brute-force attacks.

2. Implement Managed Service Accounts (MSAs):
Use MSAs which automatically manage complex passwords and reduce administrative overhead.

3. Limit Account Privileges:
Apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring service accounts have only the necessary permissions.

4. Regularly Rotate Service Account Credentials:
Periodically update passwords for service accounts to mitigate the risk of compromised credentials.
