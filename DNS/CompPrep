1. Finding Users
Linux: Use the cat /etc/passwd command to list users. This file contains user account information.
Windows: Use net user from the command line or check the "Local Users and Groups" settings under Computer Management.

2. Finding Privileged Users and Groups
Linux: You can list groups using cat /etc/group. To check who is in the sudo or wheel group (which grants admin privileges), run grep 'sudo' /etc/group or grep 'wheel' /etc/group.
Windows: You can check for users in the "Administrators" group using net localgroup Administrators in the Command Prompt.

3. Removing a User's Privileges & Removing from Privileged Group
Linux:
To remove a user from a privileged group: gpasswd -d <username> <groupname> or vigr to edit the /etc/group file.
To remove sudo privileges, edit the sudoers file using visudo and remove any lines granting sudo access to the user.

Windows:
To remove a user from the Administrators group: net localgroup Administrators <username> /delete.

4. Locking or Disabling an Account
Linux:
Locking an account: passwd -l <username>.
To disable: usermod -L <username> or chage -E 0 <username>.
Windows:
Locking an account: Use net user <username> /active:no.
Disable: You can also disable via "Local Users and Groups" in Computer Management.

5. Removing a User Account
Linux: Use userdel <username> to remove the account. Optionally, you can add the -r flag to remove the user's home directory as well: userdel -r <username>.
Windows: Use net user <username> /delete or delete the account via "Local Users and Groups".

6. Changing a User's Password
Linux: Use passwd <username> to change the user's password.
Windows: Use net user <username> <newpassword> to change the password.

7. Turning on Extra Logging
Linux:
Ensure auditd (audit daemon) is installed and configured. You can use auditctl to set up custom rules for logging specific activities.
Modify /etc/rsyslog.conf to configure logging.
Windows: Enable auditing through the Group Policy Management Console. You can enable "Audit logon events" or "Audit account logon events" under "Advanced Audit Policy Configuration."

8. Ports Required for Your Service
You should consult the documentation for the specific service you're running. For example:
HTTP typically uses port 80 (TCP).
HTTPS uses port 443 (TCP).
FTP uses ports 21 (control) and 20 (data).
Identify the required ports by consulting the service documentation or using netstat/ss to list open ports.

9. Vulnerabilities in Your Service
Identify vulnerabilities by running security tools such as:
Nmap for port scanning and service version detection.
Nikto for web application vulnerabilities.
OpenVAS for a more comprehensive vulnerability scan.
Always check for outdated software, weak encryption, unpatched services, and unnecessary open ports.

10. Uninstalling Services to Minimize Attack Surface
Linux: Use apt-get remove <service-name> or yum remove <service-name> to uninstall unwanted services.
Windows: Remove unnecessary services via "Services" (services.msc) or uninstall through "Add or Remove Programs."

11. Updating Software/Patching
Linux: Use package managers like apt-get update and apt-get upgrade (for Debian-based systems) or yum update (for RHEL-based systems).
Windows: Use Windows Update or install updates manually from the Control Panel.

12. Downloading and Running Antivirus
Linux: Use tools like ClamAV (apt-get install clamav), then run clamscan to scan for malware.
Windows: Install antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender, Malwarebytes), and schedule regular scans.

13. Finding Files with Weak Permissions
Linux: Use find / -type f ! -perm 644 to search for files with insecure permissions. Look for files that are writable by unauthorized users.
Windows: Use PowerShell to check file permissions (Get-Acl <file>).

14. Enforcing Strong Password Policies
Linux: Modify /etc/login.defs to enforce password complexity, aging, and history. Use pam_pwquality.so in /etc/pam.d/common-password.
Windows: Use "Local Group Policy Editor" or "Active Directory Users and Computers" to set password complexity and length policies.

15. Disabling Remote Access
Linux: Disable remote SSH access by commenting out or removing the PermitRootLogin and PasswordAuthentication lines in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and then restarting SSH: systemctl restart sshd.
Windows: Disable Remote Desktop from the "System Properties" -> "Remote" tab or via PowerShell: Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server" -Name fDenyTSConnections -Value 1.

16. Grabbing and Running Scripts
Linux: Download the script using wget or curl, then run it with bash: bash <script-name>.
Windows: You can run PowerShell or batch scripts. Make sure to set the execution policy if needed (Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned)
