LDAP Firewall. Lot of potential with this depending on how configuration is set up. Its primary purpose is monitoring for LDAP

You can get more granular, though; configuration can be modified to not just monitor but prevent certain actions,
such as preventing SPN enumeration (for the sake of mitigating Kerberoasting).
